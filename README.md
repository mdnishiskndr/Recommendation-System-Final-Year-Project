My final year project 2023 title "Recommendation System of User Buddy to Athlete Based on Sport Activities using Collaborative Filtering" is created on Visual Studio Code and the collaborative filtering model is created on Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language.

This project was undertaken to design a system that might suggest friends to athletes based on their preferred athletic activities. It involved developing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering algorithm and assessing the effectiveness of the developed recommendation system.

This research has also shown that it has able to integrate athletic activity preferences effectively with collaborative filtering approaches. The built recommendation system uses the Cosine Similarity algorithm and takes into consideration the dynamics of sport preferences to provide customized buddy recommendations for athletes.

The study contributes to our understanding of efficacy in offering trustworthy and pertinent buddy recommendations to athletes based on their preferred sport activities. This result represents a significant advancement in improving user experience and encouraging social interactions among the athlete community.
